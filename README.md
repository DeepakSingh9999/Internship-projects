# Side Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of web-based side projects created during my internship. This repository includes a variety of interactive web apps built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project is designed to showcase my skills in front-end development, user interface design, and problem-solving. These projects are simple yet effective in demonstrating core web development principles.

### Projects:

1. **[Blackjack Web Game](#blackjack-web-game)**

   * A classic Blackjack game where players compete against the dealer to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The game includes automatic win detection and a user-friendly interface.

2. **[Calculator Web App](#calculator-web-app)**

   * A simple, responsive calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations. The app is designed with a clean, intuitive interface for ease of use, with error handling and a clear button to reset calculations.

3. **[Basic Clock Web App](#basic-clock-web-app)**

   * A real-time digital clock that displays the current time, updating every second. It is a lightweight and simple app built with pure JavaScript, perfect for showing the time in a web environment.

4. **[Google Search Web App](#google-search-web-app)**

   * A fully functional search app mimicking Google Search. This app supports web search, image search, and advanced search features such as filtering by date range, file type, and more.

5. **[Tic-Tac-Toe Web App](#tic-tac-toe-web-app)**

   * A two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game with a simple and clean interface. The app automatically detects when a player wins and offers an option to reset the game.

6. **[To-Do List Web App](#to-do-list-web-app)**

   * A task management app that helps users stay organized by adding, marking, and deleting tasks. The app stores data using **localStorage**, so tasks persist even if the page is refreshed.

7. **[Weather Web App](#weather-web-app)**

   * A weather application that provides real-time weather updates, including temperature, humidity, wind speed. It uses the **OpenWeather API** for fetching weather data.

### Technologies Used:

* **HTML5**: Structure of the web pages.
* **CSS3**: Styling for the user interfaces (responsive design).
* **JavaScript**: Interactive elements and logic for each app.
* **APIs**: Integration with third-party services like the **OpenWeather API** for weather data.

### Features Across Projects:

* **Responsive Design**: All apps are fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Interactive Interfaces**: Intuitive UI/UX that prioritizes ease of use.
* **Local Storage Support**: Some apps (like the To-Do List) utilize browser storage to retain data.
* **No External Libraries**: Most projects are built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (except where APIs are used).

### How to Run These Projects:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/side-projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project folder**:

   ```bash
   cd side-projects
   ```

3. **Open the index.html file in your browser** to start any of the web apps.
